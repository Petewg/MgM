### xMate IDE

xMate is a freeware project manager and builder, written by Andrew Wos (andywos@unwired.com.au)   

It includes a built-in configurable source code editor and xBase language formatter.   
xMate supports Harbour, xHarbour, C, Clipper, C3, xBase++ and Flagship.   
It has a very easy GUI interface, and a built-in dependency engine.    
xMate fully automates the creation and maintenance of the project link script,   
and the project building process, while leaving you in control at all times.
