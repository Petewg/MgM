   -------------------------------

#### Description   

This Harbour MiniGUI package includes these main components:   
   
   - *Harbour MiniGUI Extended*, version `20.06` (including `update 5` and some  more additions!)    
     ( https://www.hmgextended.org/ )   
     (compiled with latest Harbour 3.2.0dev & MinGW32 10.2.0-1)   

   - *Harbour 3.2.0dev*, Harbour compiler and runtime libraries   
       (https://github.com/harbour/core)   
       (binaries built with MinGW32 10.2.0-1) 

   - *MinGW32*, version 10.2.0-1 (Rev1, Built by MSYS2 project)   
     ( https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-i686-gcc?repo=mingw32 )

For details about the above products, please visit their respective sites.   
   
*"When used together, these tools offer a free and open source, xBase oriented,    
Win32 GUI development environment, continuing the xBase tradition but with   
an extremely easy to use, genuine graphical user interface."*   

A good way to start using this package is to browse into **[samples](https://github.com/Petewg/MgM/tree/master/minigui/samples) (sub)folders**,   
and execute the **build.bat** file, found inside each of them; by doing so, you will   
build and run the included sample.  

This package might be a good choice for harbour & ex-clipper programmers seeking   
a usable way to transfer / reimplement their application(s) into the windows GUI world.   
Try it, to see if it fits with your development environment.   

:warning: Important note: It is recommended to uninstall older version (if any)  
before installing a new one, for to avoid mixing of outdated components   
with new ones. This is notably critical for harbour and/or mingw32 libraries!
