Harbour Minigui (MinGW Package)
-------------------------------

Important note: :bangbang: It is recommended to uninstall older version (if any) 
before installing a new one, for to avoid mixing of outdated components 
with new ones. This is especially critical for harbour and/or mingw32 libraries!

This Harbour MiniGUI package includes these main components:
	
   - Harbour 3.2.0dev
	  Harbour compiler and runtime libraries
	  ( https://github.com/harbour/core/ )
	
   - Harbour MiniGUI Extended version 16.12 (compiled with MinGW 6.2.0)
	  ( http://hmgextended.com/home.html/ )
	
   - Mingw 6.2.0 (Built by MinGW-W64 project)
	  ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ )

For details about the above products, please visit their respective sites.
	
"When used together, these tools offer a free and open source, xBase oriented, 
Win32 GUI development environment, continuing the xBase tradition but with
an extremely easy to use, genuine graphical user interface."

A good way to start using this package is to move into samples folder </minigui/samples>,
where inside each subfolder, you'll find a <build.bat> file which executed will build 
and run the included sample. 

This package might be a good choice for harbour & ex-clipper programmers seeking 
a usable way to transfer / reimplement their application(s) into the windows GUI world.
Try it, to see if it fits with your development environment.
