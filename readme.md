-------------------------------

####Description   

This Harbour MiniGUI package includes these main components:   
	
   - Harbour 3.2.0dev
	  Harbour compiler and runtime libraries   
	  ( https://github.com/harbour/core/ )
	
   - Harbour MiniGUI Extended version 17.02 (compiled with MinGW 6.3.0)   
	  ( http://hmgextended.com/home.html/ )
	
   - Mingw 6.3.0 (Built by MinGW-W64 project)   
	  ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ )

For details about the above products, please visit their respective sites.   
	
"When used together, these tools offer a free and open source, xBase oriented,    
Win32 GUI development environment, continuing the xBase tradition but with   
an extremely easy to use, genuine graphical user interface."   

A good way to start using this package is to browse into samples (sub)folders    
[MgM/minigui/samples], and execute the **build.bat** file, found inside each of them;   
by doing so, you will build and run the included sample.  

This package might be a good choice for harbour & ex-clipper programmers seeking   
a usable way to transfer / reimplement their application(s) into the windows GUI world.   
Try it, to see if it fits with your development environment.   

:warning: Important note: It is recommended to uninstall older version (if any)  
before installing a new one, for to avoid mixing of outdated components   
with new ones. This is notably critical for harbour and/or mingw32 libraries!
