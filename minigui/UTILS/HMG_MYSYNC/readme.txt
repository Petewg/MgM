Step by step instruction:
1. press 'New record'
2. select origin and target (empty fields Target and Origin will be ignored)
3. select the type of backup
4. press 'Save'

when you want to save changes flag active in the "ON" switch on back page and press 'Save'.
Will be processed only records of types "INC" and "FULL" with the active flag to "ON".
At the end automatically "ON" will be changed to "OFF".

for zip passing on the page and press 'Compress'.
Will be processed only records of type "ZIP" with the active flag to "ON".
At the end automatically "ON" will be changed to "OFF".

Setting 'max zip files' must be more 1.
He should be between 5 and 10.

This is because for personal experience staff I learned that only one backup file is suicide.
