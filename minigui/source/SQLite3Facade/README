=========================
SQLite3Facade for Harbour
=========================

README
======

This work is based on a Harbour build by Wagner Nunes <vagucs-at-vagucs-com-br>.

It's redundant to say that this facade is an effort to make Harbour's SQLite3
contribution library (``hbsqlit3`` and ``sqlite3`` libraries to be exact) a lot
easier to use, since this is what a facade is, makes easier complicated things.
