You may not publish, in any form, instructions, manuals, or tutorials on ZeeGrid usage.
This only relates to ZeeGrid instructions, manuals, or tutorials in a development sense.
ZeeGrid usage may be included in your own application instructions as it pertains to the
user's view and interaction with ZeeGrid. Just to clarify; Discussion, code snippets,
examples of ZeeGrid usage on user groups is fine. Writing and publishing an article or book
such as "Using ZeeGrid in Win32 Applications" is not. 

I do request that if ZeeGrid is used in a commercial or publicly distributed application,
a mention of ZeeGrid and my name (David Hillard) be put in your Help/About dialog. 

I would appreciate you letting me know what type of application ZeeGrid is being used in,
and what language/platform was used in its development. It would also be interesting if
you'd let me know what part of the world you're in. It would be cool to make a map graphic
and put it on this site showing world-wide usage of ZeeGrid.
