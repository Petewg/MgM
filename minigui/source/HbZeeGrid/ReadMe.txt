ZeeGrid - Win32 Grid Control 

ZeeGrid is an editable grid with a similar user interface to Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet.
It is released as a compiled DLL and associated header file. You need only distribute
the DLL file with your application. 

In your Windows program, you add ZeeGrid capability with the Win32-API
LoadLibrary() function. From then on, your application has access to the ZeeGrid control
that can be added and used just as easily as an edit, listbox or any other standard control. 

There are no language dependent functions required to use ZeeGrid. All interaction between
your application and ZeeGrid is accomplished with the Win32-API SendMessage() function.
This allows this single DLL-based control to be used by a wide variety of programming languages.
