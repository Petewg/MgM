All rights reserved.) Tj()'T* (This freeware screen saver is actually not a screen saver. It is) TjT* (a utility that can be set up as a screen saver, but instead of just) TjT* (showing fancy pictures \(as most other screen savers do\), ActiveSaver) TjT* (does something useful: it can run a program or open a file, or) TjT* (logoff, restart, or shut down the computer. ) Tj()'T* (You may find ActiveSaver useful if you want a program to be run each) TjT* (time your computer is idle for a number of minutes. For example, you) TjT* (can make it run a disk defragmenter or a virus scanner. You can also) TjT* (set it up to open any file instead of running a program \(for instance,) TjT* (you can make it play a particular sound, after the computer is idle) TjT* (for some time\).) Tj()'T* (ActiveSaver lets you also specify whether you want to initiate the) TjT* (logoff, restart, or shutdown process after the computer is idle long) TjT* (enough. This is especially useful for network administrators whose) TjT* (customers keep fogetting to logoff after they are all done with the) TjT* (work. You can make it display a warning message for some time before) TjT* (actually performing such an action, and the text of the message can) TjT* (be customized by you. Doing so would let the user cancel the action,) TjT* (if he or she wants to continue working with the computer. ) Tj()'T* (Installing ActiveSaver  ) TjT* (~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~) Tj()'T* (To install ActiveSaver, simply run the file ActiveSaver.exe. The file) TjT* (ActiveSaver.scr will be copied in the Windows System folder \(usually) TjT* (it is C:\\Windows\\System or C:\\Windows\\System32\), where other screensaver) TjT* (files are, because it would make ActiveSaver immediately available for) TjT* (use through the Control Panel - Desktop command.) Tj()'T* (To complete the installation, you must let Windows know that you want) TjT* (to use ActiveSaver as its default screen saver. This is done in the) TjT* (same way as if it were a regular screen saver: right-click on the) TjT* (Desktop, and select Properties from the shortcut menu. When the) TjT* (Display Properties windows pops up, select the Screen saver page, and) TjT* (then select ActiveSaver as the current screen saver.) Tj()'T* (Configuring ActiveSaver  ) TjT* (~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~) Tj()'T* (While on the Display Properties | Screen saver page, click on the) TjT* (button Settings....) Tj()'T* (The dialog box has the following areas: ) TjT* (  * Run a program or open a file, folder, or Internet resource -) TjT* (    Check this box if you want ActiveSaver to run a program or open) TjT* (    a file when it is activated by Windows. Enter the full path of) TjT* (    the program or the file you want to run in the area below the) TjT* (    checkbox. ) Tj()'T* (  * Wait for close -) TjT* (    Check this box if you want ActiveSaver to wait for the program or) TjT* (    file to be closed before continuing. This option is available) TjT* (    only if both the Run program... and Perform the action... options) TjT* (    are checked.)

You need to) TjT* (    test it with the program or file you are using to make sure it) TjT* (    works for you. ) Tj()'T* (  * Perform the action -) TjT* (    Check this box if you want ActiveSaver to logoff, restart, shutdown,) TjT* (    of power off the computer when it is activated by Windows. If both) TjT* (    the Run program... and Perform the action... options have been) TjT* (    selected, ActiveSaver first runs the program specified, and then) TjT* (    performs the action you have chosen.) TjT* (    Note that unless the Force application termination option has been) TjT* (    selected as well, Windows checks for open documents before actually) TjT* (    performing the action, and prompts the user to save them, as) TjT* (    necessary. The user may cancel the logoff or shutdown action during) TjT* (    this process. ) Tj()'T* (Note: If you have selected the Power off action, but your computer is) TjT* (      restared instead, you need to enable APM \(Advanced Power Management\),) TjT* (      using Control Panel - Power Options or similar command of Windows.) TjT* (      If it still does not help, you need to contact your computer) TjT* (      manufacturer for the updated BIOS, that properly supports APM. ) Tj()'T* (  * Display warning for ... seconds -) TjT* (    Check this box if you want ActiveSaver to display a message for) TjT* (    the specified number of seconds before actually initiating the) TjT* (    logoff, restart, or shutdown action. Use this option if you want) TjT* (    the user to be able to cancel the action and continue working with) TjT* (    the computer. ) Tj()'T* (  * Force application termination -) TjT* (    Check this box if you want ActiveSaver to force the logoff or) TjT* (    shutdown and terminate all running applications, even if the user) TjT* (    has not saved all of his documents! This is a potentially dangerous) TjT* (    option, that should be used only if absolutely necessary. Remember) TjT* (    that if the user has lost his or her unsaved data because you have) TjT* (    enabled this option, this is your responsibility, not ours! ) Tj()'T* (  * Use these settings for all users of this computer -) TjT* (    Check this box if you want ActiveSaver would be used by all users) TjT* (    of the computer.) Tj()'T* (Using ActiveSaver with Windows XP/2000/NT  ) TjT* (~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~) Tj()'T* (The administrator of Windows XP/2000/NT system may configure it to) TjT* (impose various restrictions on how screensavers can be run on that) TjT* (computer. Such restrictions may present problems for ActiveSaver,) TjT* (too, such as: ) Tj()'T* (  * If ActiveSaver is set up to run a GUI program, it may work well) TjT* (    while you are testing it through the Control Panel, but may not) TjT* (    work when you use it "for real": the GUI program will run, but) TjT* (    it may not be visible. The reason for this problem is the security) TjT* (    of Windows XP/2000/NT: it may be configured to run screensavers) TjT* (    on a separate desktop, not the same one that is used to run) TjT* (    regular programs. If this is the case, you can still use ActiveSaver) TjT* (    to run non-GUI programs, or to perform the logoff/shutdown) TjT* (    operations.)

This problem does NOT occur with Windows 98/95 or) TjT* (    in the test mode \(when you press the Test button on the Screen) TjT* (    Saver page of the Display Properties window\). ) Tj()'T* (  * For the same reason, if you set up ActiveSaver to run a program,) TjT* (    and the program to be run requires user interaction in order to) TjT* (    be closed, then such an action returns to the working desktop of) TjT* (    Windows 2000/NT.
