DESCRIPTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Attention system administrators: do users of your network 
forget to log off before leaving?
ActiveSaver may be of help: you can set it up as a screen
saver, and when the time is up, ActiveSaver would logoff,
restart, or even shut down the computer. You can make it
display a warning message before performing the action,
or run a program (for example, to clean the system up
after the last user). 

INSTALLATION: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run the file "ActiveSaver.exe". The ActiveSaver.scr will be
copied into your Windows folder, and then it will be set up.

DISTRIBUTION: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This screen saver is FREE, and may be freely copied and distributed, 
as long as it is not modified in any way, and no fee is charged for 
its distribution (small shipping and handling fee is acceptable).
