SwitchPrinter version 1.2
=========================

First of all, thank you for trying this program! 
Any your suggestions are welcome! Mail to: gfilatov@inbox.ru

General Information 
===================

SwitchPrinter is a very small and very simple program.
It runs in background and allows you to switch active printer fast.
Left-click on the printer icon to show menu and to make selected
printer active. Another advantage of this software is an option
that allows you to switch fast using floating window. You can move
floating window anywhere on the screen - just drag it to desired
position using your mouse.

Modern offices frequently have several printers connected to one
network - laser printers, jet printers, color printers, as well as
specialty printers. Some companies, particularly in the areas of
photography, design, and architecture, digital imaging and some
others, may have dozens of different printers and plotters that
they have to use every day. SwitchPrinter is specially designed
for such companies to help you make switching between printers easy,
as well as to save your time.

Requirements
============

Works on Win98, WinME, WinNT, Win2K, WinXP.
Should work on Win95 but not tested.

Installation
============

Unzip all the files into one directory. That's all!
No dll's or other complicated files to be installed!
After this you can start SwitchPrinter by double clicking
on the SwitchPrinter.exe file.
