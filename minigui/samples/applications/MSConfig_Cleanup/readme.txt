MSConfig CleanUp v1.1
---------------------

MSConfig is a powerful tool that allows you to enable/disable
the programs that start when Windows boots up.
MSConfig would be a perfect startup manager, if it allowed
you not only to disable items, but to delete them forever.
Unfortunately it does not do that.  

This is where MSConfig Cleanup comes in!
It scans the startup configurations and allows you to remove
any item that has been previously disabled via MSConfig.

MSConfig Cleanup is FREEWARE.

This program can be distributed on CD-ROM, Floppy Disks, WWW etc.
Please freely distribute.

Please contact me if you want to report bugs, grammar mistakes,
or give your opinion about the program, or any comments etc...
