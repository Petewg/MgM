Description
-----------
Focus It is a very simple program designed to enables X-Mouse style window
activation. When X-Mouse style window activation is enabled, you need only
move the mouse into a window in order to give it focus. Normally, you must
click on a window in order to give it focus.

There is option "Autoraise when activating" which is switched by Shift+Esc
global hotkey.

The program can be closed from the context menu in the tray by the mouse
right click.

Remark: it works fine in WinXP but it precipitates window flashing in Win7.
