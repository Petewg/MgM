	Intro
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	RecycleNOW is a utility that, when triggered, immediately empties the 
 	Recycle Bin. It is meant to be a timesaver as, especially on slower 
 	computers, emptying the Recycle Bin can take a while. But be warned:
 	there's no way back, no questions asked, so be careful! This is certainly 
 	not a tool for indecisive people.
