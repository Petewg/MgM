RunCmd - Run Dialog Box Replacement for Windows 9x/Me/NT/2k/XP
==============================================================

RunCmd is an imitation of the Windows run dialog box. Like
the original, it can open program files, documents or folders
and supports drag & drop.

Compared with the standard run dialog box, RunCmd has
the following advantages:

* RunCmd is a standalone executable. This means you can create
links to RunCmd and then drop files on the RunCmd icon to open
them with the command line editor. Like this, you can also
define a hotkey for RunCmd, add it to the "Send to..." menu in
Explorer by creating a link to RunCmd in your "SendTo" folder
or add it to the "Quick Launch" bar.

* The RunCmd dialog box remains open when a program is run, it
is in the background and can be activated with the Task-Switch
(Alt+Tab).

RunCmd works both on Windows 9x and Windows NT. The only file
required is "RunCmd.exe" and can be located anywhere on your
computer. Remove this file to uninstall RunCmd, no ini files
or registry entries are left.

RunCmd is FREEWARE and may be used and distributed free of
charge. The use of the software is AT YOUR OWN RISK.
