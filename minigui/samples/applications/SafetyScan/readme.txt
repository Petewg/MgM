DESCRIPTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
SafetyScan operates by regularly scanning your hard drive
for various error producing files and space wasting files,
and then optionally cleaning them from your system for you.

SafetyScan targets specific types of files that common disk
utilities, un-install, defrag, scandisk, and other “cleaner”
type programs will miss.

These error files accumulate over time, occupying megabytes
of space on your hard drive. SafetyScan will clean these files
and recover the lost space from your system. Regular use of
SafetyScan will prevent these files from accumulating and
wasting valuable disk space.

The only thing you will notice is less problems with your computer
and more hard drive space!
