What is RGB-Mixer?
==================

This program is useful to mix a color for use in web design or any
other kind of graphics artwork.
It shows the Red, Green and Blue fraction of the color and
the hexadecimal number, which can be copied to the clipboard
by pressing Enter or the "Copy to Clipboard" Main menu item.

You can choose between 3 Color Modes in the "Options" Menu.
For easier tuning a stepping of 5 is the default, but you can choose stepping 1
and stepping 51 (Netscape 216 color palette). 

The color last tuned is saved into a "RGBMixer.ini" file inside the
current directory.
The settings are saved to disk on program shutdown.


Installation
============

Unzip files into a directory of your choice and make shortcut to the RGBMixer.exe.
To remove it from your system, you just need to delete the files -
there is no settings in the registry or in another folders.

You may use and distribute this program without limitations.
