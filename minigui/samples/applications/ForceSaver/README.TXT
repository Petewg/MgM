by Grigory Filatov <gfilatov@inbox.ru>


Description
-----------
ForceSaver is a very simple program designed to start of default screen
saver when you put the mouse cursor at top left corner of display.
ForceSaver also places an icon in the System Tray when you start the
program. Right click on the tray icon to activate the program's menu.


Usage
-----
1) Copy the forcesaver.exe file to a convenient directory on your system

2) It may be convenient to create shortcuts on the desktop, in the Start
   menu, or the StartUp folder to run the program as service.  Just
   create a shortcut to the FORCESAVER.EXE program, and then change the
   "Cmd line" field on the "Program" page of the shortcut properties to add
   the command-line options "/service" (without quotation marks).


Notes
-----
* This program currently works as service only with Windows 9x/ME.
