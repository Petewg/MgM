Tray Calendar minimizes to the Windows system tray.
Tray Calendar's system tray icon shows the current
day of the month. 

Clicking on the Tray Calendar icon brings up a
virtual calendar.

The Tray Calendar main screen always starts up with
the current year and month on the calendar.

Press the calendar navigator buttons to go to any
month and year. The left and right arrows go to
previous and next months. The today label returns
you to today's date.

Click on a date to create or change the notes for
that date. Text may be entered into the edit box
just below the calendar. Text may be any length up
to 32,000 characters. 

To delete the notes for a day, simply click on the
day and delete the notes from the edit field. When
the notes edit field is empty, the notes for that
day will be deleted.

To delete all past notes (notes before today) click
on the File..Delete Notes Before Today option.

Clicking on the date display button at the bottom
of the screen will copy the current date to the
clipboard.
