DESCRIPTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
ResizeIt is a tray icon testing utility for anyone doing development
for an Internet browser. This utility allows you to test your code
within all of the default Windows screen resolutions, without changing
your own resolution. It simply resizes any browser window to 640x480,
800x600, 1024x768 or any custom size. This will allow you to verify
your html or application at different screen resolutions. 

This is a must have utility for any web developer or application designer.
There are options that allow it to stay on top, account for the Windows
taskbar, center the application within your current screen resolution or
auto refresh the application's list.

DISTRIBUTION: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program is FREE, and may be freely copied and distributed, 
as long as it is not modified in any way, and no fee is charged for 
its distribution (small shipping and handling fee is acceptable).
