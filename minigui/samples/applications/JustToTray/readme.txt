Copyright (c) 2005-2015 Grigory Filatov. All rights reserved.

DESCRIPTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
JustToTray saves precious Taskbar space for minimized windows.
When application's window is minimized the icon represents
the application on the Taskbar instead of the regular "button"
in the Taskbar.

It is particularly useful for background tasks you typically keep
running on your PC all day long like your favorite e-mail client,
Real Player, etc.

USAGE:
~~~~~~
The program will request the file for opening at first launching.
When you will start a second copy of JustToTray this request will
be repeated for second application and so on.

After that the first run of JustToTray will be started of the first
application minimized to tray icon, the second run will be started
of the second application and so on.

If the program is started with the command line parameter <number>
then it will start the application with this number.

JustToTray runs with Windows 98/2000/XP/7 and does not require any
installation.
