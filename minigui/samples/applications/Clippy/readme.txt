Clippy v1.1 Copyright (c) 2005-2007 Grigory Filatov
===================================================

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Clippy is a simulated office assistant that, when ran, will hide
in the background for 1 minute then popup in the lower right hand
corner of the screen and say something useless. Every minute, Clippy
pops up spouting useless nonsense about your computer. Clippy looks
exactly like the annoying Clippy assistant you are used to, complete
with sound and a variable size hint box based on the size of the hint.

That is not all! Clippy comes with a dozen or so default messages, but
Clippy can be customized to fit your needs. You can create a clippy.txt
file within the same directory as Clippy and when loaded, it will read
this file to figure out which hints to blurt to the screen.
If Clippy encounters a question mark (?) within the line of text, it will
display a hint box with YES NO options.

Command Line 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several command line option to Clippy.

clippy.exe [seconds to delay] [noicon]

[seconds to delay] = The number of seconds to delay between each time
Clippy is displayed. By default Clippy hides for 60 seconds each time.
[noicon] = Hide Clippy's tray icon.

Example: clippy.exe 20 noicon
This would show clippy every 20 seconds and hide the tray icon.
