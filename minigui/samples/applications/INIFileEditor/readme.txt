INI File Editor v1.0
--------------------

Description

  INI File Editor is small application that can manipulate (create 
  or edit) INI file easily. I know that INI file is just for backward 
  compatibility in Windows 9x/ME/2K/XP or above but until now many 
  professional applications still use this kind of file to store their 
  application configuration. OK, back to program again. You can add 
  section, key or key value with ease. Just right click on Section Tab
  or Key listbox and the action menu will appear.

Installation

  Installation is very easy. This program shipped in file
  called inife.zip. Unzip this file with PKUnzip or WinZip.
  3 file will be extracted:
    INIFileEditor.exe  --> program file
    INIFE.hlp          --> help file
    ReadMe.txt         --> this file
  Double click at INIFileEditor.exe and program will run.
