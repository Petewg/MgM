What is ClipbrdClear?
=====================

ClipbrdClear is a tiny free utility that allows you to clear the contents of the Windows clipboard
with a click of the mouse. ClipbrdClear places a little clipboard icon into tray area. If there is
something in the clipboard, you'll see red cross over the icon. That means that by clicking on this
icon you can clear the contents of the clipboard. That easy!
Right-clicking the icon brings up a little popup menu with some commands for launcing Clipboard Viewer etc.
If you manage to copy large images and data over the clipboard now and again then you may find this utility
useful.

Also, there are some command line switches that change behaviour of the program:

  /CLEAR   By including this switch on command line, ClipbrdClear will clear the clipboard
           when it starts up. After that it will be running in the system tray area.
  /EXIT    This switch is used along with the /CLEAR switch. It just instructs the program
           to exit after clearing the clipboard. By using both /CLEAR and /EXIT switches,
           you can use the program just to clear the clipboard, it will not remain running
           in the system tray. For example you can make a shortcut to the program in your
           QuickLaunch area of the system taskbar (including these switches), then, when
           you want to clear the clipboard just click the shortcut and you are done.
           Useful when you want to use the program occassinally. It does not consume
           system resources that way and gives you more room in the tray area for other applications.


Installation
============

Unzip files into a directory of your choice and make shortcut to the ClipbrdClear.exe into your StartUp group,
so ClipbrdClear will automatically start each time you start Windows. To remove it from your system,
you just need to delete the files - there is no settings in the registry or in another folders.
