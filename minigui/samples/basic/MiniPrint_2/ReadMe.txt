HMG Print Samples

( MiniPrint for beginners in 10 easy steps )

Printing is one of jobs most causing headaches in xBase programming.

For programmers coming from oldy - goldy DOS days printing may be bigger trouble.

DOS experiences may be an impediment instead of easiness. Because many programmer don't want 
quite their old habits and think that with a little work ( or by a magic wand ) they would convert 
( or without any conversion ) their DOS print routines may work in the Windows or any other GUI medium.

One cause of this problem is probably seeing GUI printing methods so much complex and difficult.

Main goal of this "HMG Print Samples" work is showing as far as easy using HMG MiniPrint.

Happy HMG'ing :D
