 Requirement for Win9X:
--------------------------------------
- installed ODBC-Engine

In case ODBC makes problems, you need to go to the Microsoft site,
download and install DCOM95 from
http://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom95/download.asp and then
download and install MDAC 2.8 SP1 from
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/data/aa937730.aspx
Note: DCOM95 is only needed for Windows 95 - it is not needed for
later Windows versions.
