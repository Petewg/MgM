   Question & Answer
   -----------------

Q. I can't set the rowheight of a grid.
   This is absolutelly important for applications made for touchscreen!
   I have to see a lot of informations in the grid, so, I need to write
   with small characters (Times or Arial 10), but I need space (in vertical)
   to can touch and select the correct row. How can I solve this?

A. Since HMG grid is based on standard ListView32 model, I think
   we can't change the rowheight as we wish.
   But there is a work around for this.
   Please consider this sample.
