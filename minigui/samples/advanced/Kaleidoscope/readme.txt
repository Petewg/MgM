Kaleidoscope - 3D
-----------------

Kaleidoscope - 3D is a small software to draw basic shapes like triangles, circles, ellipses, rectangles, squares and polygons by reflecting.

Stereo window can also be created for cross view. 

How to see stereo pairs?

You can go to http://www.neilcreek.com/blog/2008/02/28/how-to-see-3d-photos/ for a simple tutorial and training to feel the depth in stereo pictures without any special equipments. 

All the controls of the Kaleidoscope - 3D are simple and self explanatory. 

My sincere thanks to Roberto Lopez for his excellent library HMG (Harbour MiniGUI) without which, I could not have even developed this software. (http://harbourminigui.googlepages.com)

For the algorithm, I wish to thank Cliff (http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/ekscop.html).

The project is hosted in http://kaleidoscope3d.sourceforge.net/

Have some fun!
