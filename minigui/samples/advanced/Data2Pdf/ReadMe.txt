This program was born from the necessity to bring the data of a database
on a Pdf.
After some studies on the structure of the pdfs, I come to knowledge of the
possibility to manipulate a tool Free using them: FOXIT READER.
In fact in his last release it is present a tool called TYPEWRITER.
With such tool I insert in the pdf of the references (TOKEN) that I will use
subsequently to replace them with the real data.
FoxitReader also inserts a Watermark, that however my program removes.
Using an other FREE software: Pdftk.exe (www.pdftk.com) I get the possibility
to unite the pdfs created in an only pdf, good for the press, but perhaps
problematic for the dimensions.
Advise to use my program and Pdftk with Pdf and database of small dimensions.
The attached examples have been created with
OpenOffice and FoxitReader.
Pdftk.exe is not required, but advised
