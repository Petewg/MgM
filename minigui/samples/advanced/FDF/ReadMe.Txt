This program was born from the necessity to bring the data of a 
database on a Pdf.

In the search of a more exact way to compile in automatic way a 
form pdf, has discovered the file FDF.
In fact exporting the data of a pdf containing compilable fields
from the user, a file is gotten Fdf.
Through the specifications of this format it is possible to create a
file Fdf that if performed (double click) it reopens the file that 
has it produced and it affixes you the data on the fields.
The specifications to which report me are valid from 1996 and him 
they apply to Adobe (also the Reader) and in the last version,
also with Foxit Reader (2.3).

My program doesn't do anything else other than to create a file.ini 
that contains the specifications for the creation of the file Fdf, some 
function of manipulation of the data and a class for the writing of the
file FDF.

I Recommend to the whole community to assign, on the pdf father,
the names of the fields in capital, otherwise the file Fdf would be able
not to correctly work.

I have inserted a Pdf of example (scheda.pdf), you can fill his fields
with your database.

I leave to the imagination each of you, the changes to adapt this
utility to your demands.
