Features of ComboSearchGrid:

- I have used SQLite temporary database and table to optimize the search
- Since the combosearchgrid is based on Virtual Grid there is no limitation as to the number of rows!
  In the sample I have used 10000 rows. But you can check for more rows and find out how fast it is.
  Actually there is no program degradation because of the number of rows. 
- The text is searched in all the columns. 
- Anywhere search is also available.
- You can show/hide the headers too.
- SQLite operations are totally hidden and you need not know anything about SQLite.
