MailWithBlat.PRG contains an object which can be used to send email with BLAT.


BLAT (currently at version 2.6.2) is a long established program for sending email
using the SMTP protocol.  (BLAT can also be used to send messages to News Readers
but I have not included those functions in this object.)  MailWithBlat handles all
of the command structure for BLAT allowing the xHarbour programmer to concentrate
on the data and not the construct.  MailWithBlat is also useful for those wishing
to understand how to call a DLL from within xHarbour.

Information about BLAT can be obtained at www.blat.net.  It is an open source project
that is hosted on sourceforge.  BLAT is a relatively sophisticated program that handles
multiple variations of login procedures (authenticated and non-authenticated SMTP, POP3
before SMTP, MD5 - even when it really isn't MD5).  It handles multiple attachments, HTML
with embeded files, alternate plain text among other features.  Please see the included
syntax.html file for all of the commands and options.

MailWithBlat uses the DLL version of BLAT.  The MailWithBlat.PRG file contains code
that allows you to select how the DLL is loaded.  One can dynamically load BLAT only when
you need to send and email using calls to LOADLIBRARY and DLLCALL or you can load it
at run time and call BLAT using the link library supplied with BLAT.  This option is
selected using the _use_CallDLL define.  If it is defined then you will use the method that
loads the DLL only when needed.  The default is to use the link library which I believe
will yield faster execution times.
