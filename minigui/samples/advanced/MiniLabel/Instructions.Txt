Minilabel Demo v1.0

The scope of Minilabel is that one to read to the objects and the methods 
from rows external.  
In order to make that it needs that the objects are separabili are singularly
are in groups.  
The sections are subdivided from parenthesis quadrants beginning from [S0], 
classified to the declaration of some parameters of base until to [S(n)] 
where n it is a number to your pleasure.  

The sections preceded from # will not be executed.

In the section [S0] it is possible to define the following options:   
		  ReportName, Orientation, BodyLen, Printername 
Being executed runtime overwriting any similar commando has been given in
precedence; as an example it is possible to declare printing that it will 
have to execute the report, name of the tail of press that will appear in 
the Spooler and also in some display of printing laser.  

ORIENTATION allows to choose between Portrait and Landscape is admitted 
the compressed shape like PORT and LAND 

BODYLEN declares the maximum number of lines from 1/6 of inch that will be
printed publication in the section BODY 

PRINTERNAME is the name of printing that it will execute the press. 

Every object is constituted from a type Array tightens that of it describes
the methods.  
Obviously one is followed base outline to which applying the present objects 
in the several sections [S(n)].  
In this Demo I have subdivided the report in three main parts. 
	Header 
	Body 
	Feet 
A more complete version would have to contain:  
Header 
	  Head 
	  Body 
	  Feet 
Footer 
In every section we execute the objects that serve to us, therefore is 
possible to construct structure of the report to the inside of the program
in order then to modify it with the external definitions 

Only the methods mark to you with (* expression) will be macro expanded for 
means of one EVAL. 

In particular it marks it section COLOR that it supports is the direct names 
like BLACK, RED etcetera, that the shape rgb like [255,0,0] 
The other methods are therefore interpret to you:  
If the method is one tightens empty or contains "0" or contains ".F.", it will
return .F. 
If the method is not one tightens empty and its numerical value is greater of 1, 
or it contains ".T.", will return .T. 
Example BOLD will be .T. if declared like "1" or like ".T." 

Minilabel prints the objects declares to you in rows external following 
the following outline 

Objects:  
		  PRINT 
		  PRINT IMAGE 
		  PRINT LINE TO 
		  PRINT RECTANGLE TO 

Methods:  
[ PRINT ] 
		  ROW 
		  WIDTH
		  DATE  (* expression) 
		  FONT 
		  SIZE 
		  BOLD 
		  ITALIC 
		  UNDERLINE 
		  STRIKEOUT 
		  COLOR (* expression) 
		  ALIGN 

Example: Row  col   expr  Font   Sz  Bld  It  Und  Strk  Color  Align
          1    2     3     4     5     6   7   8    9     10      11  
		 		 
[ PRINT IMAGE ] 
		  ROW 
		  COL
		  IMAGE 
		  WIDTH 
		  HEIGHT 
		  STRETCH 

[ PRINT LINE TO ] 
		  ROW 
		  WIDTH
		  TOROW 
		  TOCOL 
		  PENWIDTH 
		  COLOR (* expression) 

[ PRINT RECTANGLE TO ] 
		  ROW 
		  WIDTH
		  TOROW 
		  TOCOL 
		  PENWIDTH 
		  COLOR (* expression) 
		  ROUNDED 

Example   Row   Col   PRINT   ToRow  ToCol  Width  Color  [Rounded]
           1     2     3        4      5      6      7       8          

The objects come recognized automatically from the third parameter of the method.  
I send back you to the Report1.Fld rows in order to try with hand as she works.  

IMPORTANT
All the measures are in Millimeters.
If not present, the Report1.Fld rows it will come created
automatically confirming printing in the SetPrinter section!
This job compile with Minigui or HMG distributions.

Please contact me if you want to report bugs, grammar mistakes,
or give your opinion about the program, or any comments etc...

This is all, good life to all
