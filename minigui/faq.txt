What is HMG Extended Edition ?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Well.. for the new people approaching HMG EE we can say that this is
a mix between one of the best programming and data manipulation languages
ever created (xBase) and the simple GUI commands based upon VB RapidQ
style and WinAPI.

All GUI objects are public and can be created and managed with very simple
code.

The basic components of HMG Extended Edition are:

* Harbour (or xHarbour) Compiler (generates C code from xBase code).

* Harbour MiniGUI Extended library (functions and preprocessor directives
  to handle GUI).

* Borland C++ (most often used), MinGW, Open Watcom or Pelles C compilers.

* Harbour MiniGUI IDE (optional tool for two-way visual design).

What are the main project goals ?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
To keep the GUI handling as easy, elegant and clean as possible and the
library core as compact, stable and reliable as we can.

At the same time we provide a regular updating of the core for the recent
Git version of the Harbour Compiler.

Other of the main goal is to hide the complexities associated with the
operating system internals, allowing to the programmer, focus on his
application, instead OS technical things.
