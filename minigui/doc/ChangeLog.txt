             hControl := GetProperty ( FormName, ControlName, 'Handle' )
           - pseudo-OOP syntax:

           - <DEFINE | CREATE> BKBRUSH <brush> [ STYLE ] PATTERN ;

2016/09/21: HMG Extended Edition version 16.09.
  * Fixed: Wrong executing of a new debug logging at console or mixed appls
           (introduced in the build 16.08).
           Problem was reported by Mitja Podgornik.
           You can enable the logging output if you uncommented the constant
           _HMG_OUTLOG in the minigui header file. By default this is turned
           off to preserve the proper Harbour functionality.
           (look at minigui.ch in folder \include)
           Syntax of the logging output is below:
              ?  <explist,...>
              ?? <explist,...>
              ?a <arr>
              ?v <arr>
           There is also the optional command SET LOGFILE TO <filename>.
           (see demo in folder \samples\Basic\OptionBox)
  * New: The Task Dialog support is based upon the Vista's TaskDialog API:

             dwCommonButtons, nIcon, @nButton ) -> nResult
           - win_TaskDialogIndirect0( aConfig, @nButton, @nRadioButton, ;
             @lVerificationFlagChecked ) -> nResult
           - useful CLASS TTaskDialog FUNCTION TaskDialog.
             Usage:
             WITH OBJECT TaskDialog()
                :Title       := 'Simple TaskDialog'
                :Instruction := 'My Main Text here'
                :Content     := 'A simple text only function TaskDialog()'
                IF :Execute()
                   MsgInfo( :ButtonResult )
                ENDIF
             ENDWITH
           Note: This feature works properly at Windows Vista or later only.

             If the configuration file is not present, the sequence of actions
             is the same as before.

  * New: Added Message Box with a timeout, the message box closes itself after

           Syntax:
           nRet := MessageBoxTimeout( Text, Caption, nButtonFlag, nMilliSeconds )
           The function returns an integer value of either a MB_TIMEDOUT value
           (indicating the timeout period was reached and the Message Box auto
           closed), or a value representing the button the user clicked. 
           Notice that the return value is always 1, when a message box with
           only an OK button (MB_OK flag) is used.

  * New: Optional Strongly-Typed Variables assignment is available for

           assign a specific type value to declaration that does not have an initial
           value assigned to it.
           Example:
                    LOCAL cVar AS STRING
           This declaration will initially assign an empty string value
           to the variable cVar.
           There is a command that will assign a value and check for type of value
           being assigned instead of using the traditional := assignment operator:
                    ASSIGN cVar := "This is a String"
           Any attempt to assign a value of a different type using this statement
           will result in a run-time error.
           You may continue to declare your variables with the assignment option
           in the traditional manner also.

             * harbour/include/hbapi.h
             * harbour/source/vm/extend.c
               * renamed existing hb_par*() and hb_stor*() functions which supports
                 variable number of parameters (...) into hb_parv*() and hb_storv*()
               * added new hb_par*() and hb_stor*() functions which use strict number
                 of parameters. New hb_par*() functions do not make hidden conversion
                 between types, f.e. hb_parl() returns 1 only for logical parameters
                 which contain .T.
           NOTE: INCOMPATIBLE. You'll need to modify hb_par*()/hb_stor*()
                 instances where they are used with extra parameter to
                 hb_parv*()/hb_storv*(). [vszakats]
           NOTE: INCOMPATIBLE. hb_parnl() no longer pulls the value of
                 date types. If you want to retrieve date as numeric value,
                 use hb_pardl(). hb_parl() will no longer consider numeric
                 non-zero values as true. [vszakats]

  * Updated: Synchronized an Extended HMG with an Official HMG 2.0.010:
           - New: HMG User Components Support.

		I've created a standard interface to allow HMG users to create
		its own components (ie: new controls) without need to modify 
		HMG library itself.

		HMG User Components Reference:
	
		- InstallEventHandler ( <cEventHandlerFunctionName> )

		Every time that an event is triggered by the system the specified
		function will be called.

		This function will receive the following parameters:

				hWnd, nMsg, wParam, lParam
		
		If your function process the message, it must return a not NIL
		value. If not, it must return NIL.

		- InstallMethodHandler( <cMethodName>, <cMethodHandlerProcName> )

		Every time that specified method is called, your procedure will
		be executed.

		If your procedure process the method, you must set the user
		process flag _HMG_UserComponentProcess to .T. If not, you must 
		set it to .F.

		- InstallPropertyHandler( <cPropName>, <cSetFucName>, <cGetFuncName> )

		When the specified property is set, <cSetFucName> is called 
		with all the original parameters		

		When the specified property is value retrieved <cGetFucName> is 
		called with all the original parameters.

		In both cases if your functions process the property, you must 
		set the user process flag _HMG_UserComponentProcess to .T. 
		If not, you must set it to .F.

		- Other Considerations:

		If you've created components that requires #command directives
		(ie. a control) you must add these definitions to i_UsrInit.ch
		file located at HMG's INCLUDE folder.

		The definitions must include start and end markers that will be
		used to allow the creation of automated installation and 
		maintenance procedures for components. 

		The format for start marker is:

		#define BASEDEF_<YourComponentTypeName>

		The format for end marker is:

		#undef BASEDEF_<YourComponentTypeName>

		If you've created methods or properties with new names (not
		currently specified in i_windows.ch, DECLARE WINDOW command
		definition) you must add translation directives for them in
		'i_UsrSOOP.ch' file, located at HMG's INCLUDE folder.

		The definitions must include start and end markers too and the 
		translation directives must follow special rules.

		The format for start marker is:

		#define SOOP_<YourComponentTypeName> ;;

		The format for translation directives for methods is:

		#xtranslate <Window> . \<Control\> . MethodName  => Domethod ( <"Window">, \<"Control"\> , "MethodName" ) ;;

		The format for translation directives for properties is:

		#xtranslate <Window> . \<Control\> . PropName  => GetProperty ( <"Window">, \<"Control"\> , "PropName" )  ;;
		#xtranslate <Window> . \<Control\> . PropName  := \<v\> => SetProperty ( <"Window">, \<"Control"\> , "PropName" , \<v\> )  ;;

		The format for end marker is:

		#undef SOOP_<YourComponentTypeName> ;;

           - Changed: All of the begin/add/delete routines now add an empty char value
             when a page is defined without an image.
           - Enhanced: the routine checks for the FIRST image FOUND which may not be
             the first element of the image array.
             So now images are displayed even if not all of the pages have an image defined.
